description: During my frehman year of college in 2007, a road trip to a small coal mining town nestled in the hills of West Virginia sparked within me a strong desire to explore outer space. Two years later – in 2009 – I read about MIT students who managed to capture photos of the earth from the stratosphere using an inexpensive high-altitude balloon and digital camera. Although I knew the balloon had not technically traveled to space, I immediately decided to attempt this project, myself.
