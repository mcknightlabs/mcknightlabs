I have never enjoyed visiting traditional fitness centers for exercise; I am much more in my element when climbing mountains or swimming in the ocean.

But what if we could reimagine the traditional fitness center and somehow bring the outdoors inside? With advancements in augmented reality (AR), this is becoming increasingly possible. 

As an experiment, I asked myself, what could that look like in practice? How immersive and exciting can we recreate the outdoor exercise experience indoors?
