title: Optimizing Industry Dive's email newsletters
image: /media/img/projects/newsletters/newsletters.png
description: I became responsible for the design and development of Industry Dive's email newsletter templates in 2012. Back then, they were fluid grid. Over the years, I converted them all to fluid-responsive hybrid. Keeping a basic fluid structure meant we could maintain broad client-support while the adoption of media quieries allowed for progressive enhancement. My team has also rearchitected our templates to optimize for less code, better client support and smaller file sizes.

		<p>As the design team at Industry Dive grew, I started to look for ways to showcase our best work and attract high quality talent. One way in which I sought to achieve this was through the creation of a Jekyll-based blog hosted with Github Pages. Not only has the external blog helped us with recruiting, the development and maintenance of the site has been a favorite project of the front-end designers on the team.</p>
