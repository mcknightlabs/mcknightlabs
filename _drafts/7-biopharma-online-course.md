Klotz</a>, a former Assistant Professor of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology at Harvard University and William Diel, Coordinator of Online Graduate Programs in the Adult Education program and Assistant Professor at Penn State.

		<p>As the design team at Industry Dive grew, I started to look for ways to showcase our best work and attract high quality talent. One way in which I sought to achieve this was through the creation of a Jekyll-based blog hosted with Github Pages. Not only has the external blog helped us with recruiting, the development and maintenance of the site has been a favorite project of the front-end designers on the team.</p>
