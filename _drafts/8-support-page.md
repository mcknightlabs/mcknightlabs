title: Building the Industry Dive internal support page
description: When Industry Dive moved its project management to Jira and Confluence in 2017, the engineering team's Technical Project Manager created a Jira ticket collector for tech support requests and embedded it in a simple web page. I immediately decided to teach myself enough about Jira and Confluence to set up for my own ticket collector for the design team. Within two years, the design team went through three iterations of the support page. The latest version has Jira ticket collectors and easy access to resource materials for every department.

		<p>As the design team at Industry Dive grew, I started to look for ways to showcase our best work and attract high quality talent. One way in which I sought to achieve this was through the creation of a Jekyll-based blog hosted with Github Pages. Not only has the external blog helped us with recruiting, the development and maintenance of the site has been a favorite project of the front-end designers on the team.</p>
