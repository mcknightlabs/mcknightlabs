title: UNCW Oral History Collection interview
description: During my senior year of undergrad, I turned 40 hours of video interviews with military chaplains into a 45 minute documentary. The interviews had been conducted as part of an oral history project for the University of North Carolina at Wilmington. This is an interview I gave with Michelle Saxton of Wrightsville Beach Magazine about the project.
