Growing up in rural, eastern North Carolina, I was surrounded by thousands of tobacco and cotton fields. Large diesel generators fed water through a maze of PVC pipes to keep these crops alive. Was there a more efficient way to irrigate? On the back of my middle school homework assignments, I sketched biomimicry-based solutions that used artificial and bio-engineered leaves to generate the necessary electricity to run the pumps. Thirteen-year-old me believed such an approach could one day save money for the farmers in my community. I also liked this idea because of a personal desire to more closely interweave the natural environment with my own experience.
