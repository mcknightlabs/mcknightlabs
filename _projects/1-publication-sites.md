		<p>I've led the design and front-end development of Industry Dive's Django-based <a href="https://www.biopharmadive.com/">news publication sites</a> since early 2013. During that time, I've managed a redesign from desktop/mobile to responsive and launched numerous new features.</p>

			<h2>2013</h2>
			<p>Below is a screenshot of what Industry Dive's news publication websites looked like prior to my arrival in November of 2012.</p>
			<p>Soon after joining, I expressed an interest in helping with web design.</p>
			<p>I had completed a couple of web development classes in high school and had spent many hours coding my own portfolio sites – static and Wordpress – to showcase my videography work in undergrad. I was certainly no front-end developer, but I knew enough to start contributing in small ways and committed myself to improving my skills.</p>
			<p>Within a year, product design and front-end development were key parts of my job.</p>

			<h2>2014</h2>
			<p>By 2014, I had already started to improve the UX and UI of our publication sites.</p>
			<p>Updates included:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Made it much easier for readers to sign up for our email newsletter (core to our business model)</li>
				<li>Improved the user experience of our site navigation</li>
				<li>Updated the color palette to a more neutral black and white so calls to action would be easier to spot</li>
				<li>Improved the presentation of our publication logos</li>
				<li>Increased the size of our news article images to make the stories feel more engaging.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>2016</h2>
			<p>Updates included:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Increased the overall aesthetic of our publication sites by shifting away from boxing content. This allowed me to get rid of the old brown site background and provided me with more negative space with which to work.</li>
				<li>Increased the size of our social share buttons on article pages to increase reader engagement.</li>
				<li>Added links to other news stories on the left of our article pages to simplify navigation</li>
				<li>Added a super-leaderboard ad spot</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Around this time, I also made my first front-end design hires – Nan Copeland and Jordan Branch.</p>

			<h2>2018</h2>
			<p>The current version of the site represents a significant departure from all previous iterations.</p>
			<p>In late 2016, Nan, Jordan and I redesigned the entire front-end of the site, building a responsive structure and eliminating our separate mobile version. Following that large redesign project, our design and front-end development progress greatly accelerated, and I hired another front-end designer – Natalie Forman. As a team, we rolled out a host of new features – e.g. a way for users to purchase and list job postings, custom responsive native ads, a topic menu, a better signup process, and much more.</p>
			<p>Another key difference you will notice in the screenshot below is Industry Dive's new logo.
