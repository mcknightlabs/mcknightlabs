title: Redesigning a corporate website while learning responsive web design
description: I redesigned and coded the front-end of Industry Dive's corporate website in 2013, teaching myself responsive web design in the process. Between 2014-18, I hired three front-end designers (front-end developer / product designer hybrids) to further develop the site, along with our other web properties.
