			<h2>The initial ask</h2>
			<p>In 2017, the editorial team decided to experiment with a new type of journalism format - the podcast.</p>
			<p>Given my prior training in film and video production, I was pulled into the project for advice.</p>
			<p>Realizing that this was simply an experiment, I offered to loan the Editorial department my personal Zoom H1N recorder and Rhode lav mic.</p>

			<h2>Hardware</h2>
			<p>After several months of podcast production with my loaner equipment, the journalists approached me about potentially acquiring higher-quality gear. I drafted a list of hardware recommendations and shared it with the company's founders for purchasing approval.</p>
			<p>My list included Rhode USB desktop microphones, sound proofing material and a dedicated iMac for editing.</p>

			<h2>Software</h2>
			<p>Then came the software setup – I signed up our editors for Adobe Audacity accounts and made it easy for them to save files to our company Dropbox account.</p>

			<h2>Product design and development</h2>
			<p>Finally came the web design and development – I managed and QAed the UI mockups, front-end code and UX of our <a href="https://www.retaildive.com/topic/podcasts/">Soundcloud integration with our publication websites</a>.</p>
