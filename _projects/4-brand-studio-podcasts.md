title: Establishing podcasting at Industry Dive
description: When the editorial team approached me about helping with a podcasting setup, I didn't quite realize how involved the project would be. It started out with hardware research and acquisition – I selected and ordered the mics, recording equipment and an iMac for the editing. Then came the software setup – I signed up our editors for Adobe Audacity accounts and made it easy for them to save files to our company Dropbox account. Finally came the web design and development – I managed and QAed the UI mockups, front-end code and UX of our Soundcloud integration with our publication websites.
