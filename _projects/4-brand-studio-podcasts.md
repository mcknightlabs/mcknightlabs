			<h2>The initial ask</h2>
			<p>In 2017, the editorial team decided to experiment with a new journalism format - the podcast.</p>
			<p>Given my prior training in film and video production, I was brought into the project for technical advice.</p>
			<p>Realizing that this was simply an experiment, I offered to loan the Editorial department my personal <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Zoom-H4N-Digital-Multitrack-Recorder/dp/B01DPOXS8I">Zoom H4N recorder</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Rode-LAVALIER-Condenser-Microphone-Omni/dp/B003Z8OUUA">Rhode lav mic</a>.</p>

			<h2>Hardware</h2>
			<p>After several months of podcast production with my loaner equipment, the journalists approached me about potentially acquiring higher-quality gear. I drafted a list of hardware recommendations. After receiving purchasing approval from company leadership, I ordered the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/">Rode NT-USB USB Condenser Microphone</a></li>
				<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B016YKNI26/">Audio-Technica ATH-M30x Professional Studio Monitor Headphones</a></li>
				<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00KHQW6JU/">Rode Microphones SC6 Dual TRRS input and Headphone Output for Smartphones</a></li>
				<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00EO4A7L0/">2 of Rode smartLav+ Lavalier Microphone for iPhone and Smartphones</a></li>
				<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B012OFI25I/">LyxPro VRI-10 Portable Adjustable Sound Absorbing Vocal Recording Panel</a></li>
				<li>27" iMac</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Software</h2>
			<p>Following the hardware purchase, I set up Adobe accounts for our editors so they could use Adobe Audition for sound editing on the new iMac.</p>
			<p>I also set up a dedicated multi-media project directory on Dropbox for the editors to easily back up and remotely access project files.</p>

			<h2>Product design and development</h2>
			<p>After the podcast production with the new equipment was in full swing, we set up a <a href="https://www.retaildive.com/topic/podcasts/">dedicated page</a> on our publication sites for users to easily browse episodes. To reduce navigation friction and improve the overall podcast listening experience, my team also designed and helped implement a custom Soundcloud API integration. This allows users to play the podcasts without leaving our site.</p>
