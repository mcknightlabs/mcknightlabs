title: Building the Industry Dive internal support page
description: When Industry Dive moved its project management to Jira and Confluence in 2017, the engineering team's Technical Project Manager created a Jira ticket collector for tech support requests and embedded it in a simple web page. I immediately decided to teach myself enough about Jira and Confluence to set up for my own ticket collector for the design team. Within two years, the design team went through three iterations of the support page. The latest version has Jira ticket collectors and easy access to resource materials for every department.
