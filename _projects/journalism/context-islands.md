og_description: The NYT has the “<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/upshot">Upshot</a>,” WaPo the "<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/">Monkey Cage</a>," and Bloomberg the “<a href="http://www.bloombergview.com/quicktake">Quicktake</a>. The Economist publishes “<a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains">The Economist Explains</a>” and Slate an “<a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer.html">Explainer</a>” column. Then there are a whole host of pubs entirely dedicated to the "explanatory" endeavor – <a href="http://www.syriadeeply.org/">Syria Deeply</a>, <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/">FiveThirtyEight</a>, and <a href="https://decorrespondent.nl/en">De Correspondent</a>, just to name a few. When and why did this shift toward greater context begin?
