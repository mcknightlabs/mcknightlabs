<h2>My story</h2>

<p>After graduating from The London School of Economics in 2012, I joined <a href="https://www.industrydive.com/">Industry Dive</a>, a business journalism startup, as <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/startup/2018-02-05-startupjob.md %}"> employee #5</a> and taught myself the fundamentals of design and front-end development.</p>

<p>I founded the following areas of design and multi-media at Industry Dive: <a href="https://industrydive.design/ux/2018/01/04/cms-audit-user-flows.html">UX design</a>, <a href="https://industrydive.design/product/2017/12/20/library-page.html">UI design</a>, <a href="https://industrydive.design/product/2018/03/29/flex-menu.html">(agile) front-end development</a>, <a href="https://industrydive.design/editorial/2018/03/08/dive-awards-2017.html">editorial graphics</a>, <a href="https://www.constructiondive.com/news/photos-of-new-smithsonian-african-american-museum/420671/">photo journalism</a> and <a href="https://industrydive.design/corporate/2018/05/09/logo-redesign.html">graphic design</a>.</p>

<p>Within six years, I built a seven-member multidisciplinary <a href="https://industrydive.com/">design team</a> that won 8 <a href="https://www.industrydive.com/news/post/honoring-industry-dives-award-winning-design-leader/">American Graphic Design Awards</a> and helped scale the company to over 100 FTEs and $15M+ in revenue.</p>

<p>In 2017, I was recognized as an "<a href="http://www.siia.net/bims/SPECIAL-PROGRAMS/Emerging-Leader-Awards">Emerging Leader</a>" in the B2B media industry for my work at Industry Dive and, in 2018, served as a judge in the same <a href="https://www.siia.net/bims/SPECIAL-PROGRAMS/Emerging-Leader-Awards">national awards competition</a>.</p>
