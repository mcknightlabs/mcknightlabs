<h2>Full bio</h2>

<p>After graduating from <a href="http://www.lse.ac.uk/">LSE</a> in 2012, I joined <a href="https://www.industrydive.com/">Industry Dive</a>, a business journalism startup, as <a href="{{ site.url }}/blog/2018/02/05/startupjob">employee #5</a> and taught myself the fundamentals of design and front-end development.</p>

<p>I founded the following areas of design and multi-media at Industry Dive: <a href="https://design.industrydive.com/ux/2018/01/04/cms-audit-user-flows.html">UX design</a>, <a href="https://design.industrydive.com/product/2017/12/20/library-page.html">UI design</a>, <a href="https://design.industrydive.com/product/2018/03/29/flex-menu.html">(agile) front-end development</a>, <a href="https://design.industrydive.com/editorial/2018/03/08/dive-awards-2017.html">editorial graphics</a>, <a href="https://www.constructiondive.com/news/photos-of-new-smithsonian-african-american-museum/420671/">photo journalism</a> and <a href="https://design.industrydive.com/corporate/2018/05/09/logo-redesign.html">graphic design</a>.</p>

<p>Within six years, I built an eight-person multidisciplinary <a href="https://design.industrydive.com/">design team</a> that won 8 <a href="https://www.industrydive.com/news/post/honoring-industry-dives-award-winning-design-leader/">American Graphic Design Awards</a> and helped scale the company to over 100 FTEs and $15M+ in revenue.</p>

<p>In 2017, I was recognized as an "<a href="http://www.siia.net/bims/SPECIAL-PROGRAMS/Emerging-Leader-Awards">Emerging Leader</a>" in the B2B media industry for my work at Industry Dive and, in 2018, served as a judge in the same <a href="https://www.siia.net/bims/SPECIAL-PROGRAMS/Emerging-Leader-Awards">national awards competition</a>.</p>

<p>Read about my startup and management experiences <a href="{{ site.url }}/blog/2017/03/05/management">here</a>.</p>

<p>On nights and weekends, I have worked as a UI/UX consultant for a <a href="https://lyflynks.com/">healthcare startup</a> in the caregiving space, volunteered with an <a href="http://mach30.org/">open source aerospace group</a> and helped my barber launch a <a href="https://www.callfigaro.com/">mobile salon</a> in DC.</p>

<h2>Self-mastery is what drives me</h2>

<p>I am a scuba diver, freediver, wilderness first aid responder, <a href="http://divegoals.com/uwp/2018/01/30/uwphotography.html">underwater photographer</a> and alpine mountaineer. I have photographed the earth <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% link _projects/space/2016-06-24-hab-part-2.md %}">from the stratosphere</a>, marine life in the <a href="http://divegoals.com/dive/2018/01/29/galapagos.html">Gal√°pagos</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BhjlN3wjOvB/?taken-by=divegoals">shipwrecks</a> in the Red Sea. I have also trekked to <a href="http://summitgoals.com/ascents/2016/11/05/everest.html">Everest Base Camp</a> and summited <a href="http://summitgoals.com/ascents/2017/01/12/kilimanjaro.html">Mt.
