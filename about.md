<h2>My story</h2>

<p>While studying international technology policy at The London School of Economics in 2012, I decided to jump from the social sciences to a career in tech. After completing my MSc in Global Politics, I joined <a href="https://www.industrydive.com/">Industry Dive</a>, a business journalism startup, as <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/startup/2018-02-05-startupjob.md %}"> employee #5</a> and taught myself the fundamentals of design and front-end development.</p>

<p>I founded the following areas of design and multi-media at Industry Dive: <a href="https://industrydive.design/ux/2018/01/04/cms-audit-user-flows.html">UX design</a>, <a href="https://industrydive.design/product/2017/12/20/library-page.html">UI design</a>, <a href="https://industrydive.design/product/2018/03/29/flex-menu.html">(agile) front-end development</a>, <a href="https://industrydive.design/editorial/2018/03/08/dive-awards-2017.html">editorial graphics</a>, <a href="https://www.constructiondive.com/news/photos-of-new-smithsonian-african-american-museum/420671/">photo journalism</a> and <a href="https://industrydive.design/corporate/2018/05/09/logo-redesign.html">graphic design</a>.</p>

<p>Within six years, I built an eight-member multidisciplinary <a href="https://industrydive.design/">design team</a> and helped scale the company to 7 million+ users, $22 million+ in revenue and 130 full-time employees.</p>

<p>In 2018, Industry Dive appeared on <em>Inc.</em> magazine's list of <a href="https://www.industrydive.com/news/post/inc-names-industry-dive-one-of-the-fastest-growing-private-companies-in-america/">fastest-growing private companies in America</a>. The company was also recognized as a "<a href="https://www.industrydive.com/news/post/industry-dive-honored-as-top-workplace-and-red-hot-company/">Best Place to Work</a>" in DC by the Washington Post in 2017 and 2018.</p>
